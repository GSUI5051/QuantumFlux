# QuantumFlux
Yay!

This is a small game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Webpage: https://reinhardt-c.github.io/QuantumFlux/

How to Play:

You start with 1 QFID (Quantum Field Interaction Device) which will start generating ₽ (particles, not Russian money) for you.

With ₽ you can buy more QFID's to make more ₽ until you have enough ₽ to buy higher level builders to make QFID's automatically and so on.

Boosts start at 1000₽ and multiply the speed of every fluctuator you own.

The aim to make so many particles that your black hole is used up (can be monitored in the Black Hole tab) and you start the game over with a production multiplier and a bigger black hole.
